# cake

A minimal todo list organization tool, written in rust to learn it.
It tries to stay out of your way. Files are saved in json or markdown format.

## Features I want

- hierachical todos
- filter and search options for listing todos
- time tracking for todos
- readable markdown serialization
- user wide and project based todo files
- stats (https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)
